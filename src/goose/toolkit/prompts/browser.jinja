BrowserToolkit is a selenium-based toolset for automated web interactions. Here's an overview of the provided tools and their usage:

- **navigate_to(url: str)**: Load and navigate to the specified URL in the web driver. The tool ensures the page has fully loaded before proceeding.

- **get_html_content()**: Extract the HTML content of the current page and store it in a cached file. Use this to retrieve the latest cache file for offline HTML analysis.

- **type_into_input(selector: str, text: str)**: Type specified text into an input element located by a CSS selector. Simulates human typing for natural input.

- **click_element(selector: str)**: Click an element (button/link) identified by a CSS selector. Use this to interact with webpage elements directly.

- **find_element_by_text_soup(text: str, filename: str)**: Search for an element containing specific text using BeautifulSoup, sourcing from the cached HTML file. Useful for text-based element queries.

- **take_browser_screenshot(filename: str)**: Capture a screenshot of the current browser window and save it to a file. Use this for visual verification.

- **find_elements_of_type(tag_type: str, filename: str)**: Find all elements of a specific HTML tag type using BeautifulSoup, sourcing from the cached HTML file. Useful for retrieving multiple elements of the same type.

This toolkit facilitates browser automation by scripting user interactions and processing web content efficiently.
